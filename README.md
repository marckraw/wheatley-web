## ENVs
To run the project you have to set up `.env` file with envs (proper values you should know, or ask @marckraw): 
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=asdf
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=asdf
CREDENTIALS_LOGIN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/api/public/login
GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/api/public/login/google
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/ - for dev
```

## Getting Started

After clone, install deps:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the NextJS development server (will clean all cache):

```bash
yarn clean:run:dev
```

To run it, without cleaning cache: 
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

If u want to build static production version, run
```bash
yarn serve:export:production
```

If u want to analyze what was bundled to final prod pacakge run:
```bash
yarn serve:export:production:analyze
```

## Storybook
We have also, Storybook, which is nice way to document react or other frameworks components, to run develop Storybook, run
```bash
yarn storybook
```

It will be available for you on `localhost:6006`

Production version of components documentation is also available online at: https://bystro-design-system.netlify.app (master branch)
